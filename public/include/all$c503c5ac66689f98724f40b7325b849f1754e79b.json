It is easy for machines to parse and generate. \n    It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. \n    This feature can also be found in Python. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent \n    but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including\n     C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, TCL, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal\n     data-interchange language.\n\n    This package provides a simple encoder and decoder for JSON notation. It is intended for use\n     with client-side Javascript applications that make use of HTTPRequest to perform server \n    communication functions - data can be encoded into JSON notation for use in a client-side\n     javascript, or decoded from incoming Javascript requests. JSON format is native to Javascript, \n    and can be directly eval()'ed with no further parsing overhead."
